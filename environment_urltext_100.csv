The Department for Transport (DfT) has reviewed Transport Direct and found that equivalent travel information services are now widely available online from several other sources. Transport Direct was launched in 2004 as the first journey planner to cover England Scotland and Wales. Since then it has served more than 160 million travel information requests as well as helping spectators plan their routes to the London 2012 Olympic Games. In the past few years the government has worked with transport operators to make timetable data freely available to web developers. As a result a number of journey planning websites have emerged offering similar services to Transport Direct such as: AA route planner (for car journey planning) Cyclestreets (for cycle journey planning) Google maps (for public transport and car journey planning) National Rail enquiries (for train journey planning) Ordnance Survey (maps) RAC route planner (for car journey planning) Royal Mail (find a postcode or address) TfL plan a journey (for public transport in London) Traveline (for public transport) Traveline south east (for public transport) walkit.com (for planning walks) These provide information such as: national journey planners for public transport car and cycle rail and coach fares information maps of routes areas and interchanges After Transport Direct closes DfT will continue to take an active interest in journey planning. The department will also assist others in the provision of comprehensive accurate travel information services.
